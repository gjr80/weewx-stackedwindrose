    # This section contains the options for the Weewx-WD Stacked Wind Rose
    # image generator. A number of plotting options can be set such as colour,
    # fonts, sizes etc. Some options have default values if the option or value
    # is omitted, these defaults are specified where applicable.
    #
    # Fonts can be anything accepted by the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which
    # is currently truetype (.ttf), or PIL's own font format (.pil). See
    # http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/imagefont.htm for more
    # details.  Note that "font size" is only used with truetype (.ttf)
    # fonts. For others, font size is determined by the bit-mapped size,
    # usually encoded in the file name (eg courB010.pil).
    #
    # Colors can be specified any of three ways:
    #   1. Notation 0xBBGGRR;
    #   2. Notation #RRGGBB; or
    #   3. Using an English name, such as 'yellow', or 'blue'.
