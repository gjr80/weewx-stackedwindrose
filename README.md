# Windrose Image Generator for weewx

## Description
The Stacked Windrose Image Generator for weewx is a `weewx` extension that generates a polar windrose plot image file based upon `weewx` archive data. The image file is suitable for publishing on a web page, inclusing in a `weewx` template or for use elsewhere.

The extension consists of a single `weewx` skin that controls a custom image generator. Various image parameters including the plot period, source data field, units of measure and colours can be controlled through settings in `weewx.conf`.

Below is an example polar windrose plot generated by the Stacked Windrose Image Generator for weewx.

## Pre-Requisites

Weewx v3.2.0 or greater.

## File Locations

As `weewx` file locations vary by system and installation method, the following symbolic names, as per the User's Guide to the weewx Weather System - [Installing Weewx](http://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#installing), are used in these instructions: 

- $BIN_ROOT (executables)  
- $SKIN_ROOT (skins and templates)  
- $HTML_ROOT (web pages and images)  

Where applicable the nominal location for your system and installation type should be used in place of the symbolic name


## Installation Instructions

1.	Download the Stacked Windrose Image Generator for weewx extension package from the [Releases](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-stackedwindrose/releases "weewx-stackedwindrose Releases page on GitHub") page. The current release package is named `stackedwindrose-2.0.2.tar.gz`. If your `weewx` PC has internet access you may be able to download the package directly as follows:

		$ wget -P /var/tmp/ https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-stackedwindrose/releases/download/v2.0.2/stackedwindrose-2.0.2.tar.gz

1.	Run the installer:

    	$ ./wee_extension --install=/var/tmp/stackedwindrose-2.0.2.tar.gz
    
    This command assumes the user is currently in the $BIN_ROOT folder.

1.	Various attributes of the generated plot can be controlled through a number of settings in the `[StdReport]` `[[StackedWindRose]]` section in `weewx.conf`. This approach has the advantage of retaining user settings across upgrades of this extension but any change to these paramaters will require a `weewx` configuration reload or a `weewx` stop/start. The extension installer does not permit comments to be included in `weewx.conf` so the windrose plot parameters and explanatory notes are included below. Commonly changed options include the units of measure (`group_speed` parameter) and date-time format (`time_stamp` parameter). Edit any parameters as required:

1.	By default the Stacked Windrose Image Generator for weewx generator places the generated file in the `$HTML_ROOT` folder. If you wish to place the generated files in another directory then insert a `HTML_ROOT` setting giving the applicable folder under the `[[StackedWindRose]]` sub-section in the `[StdReport]` section of `weewx.conf`, eg:

	    [[StackedWindRose]]
	        skin = StackedWindRose
	        HTML_ROOT = /use/this/folder

1.	Restart `weewx`:

    	$ sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
	    $ sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start

1.	This will result in the windrose image file being generated during each report generation cycle. Generation can be confirmed by inspecting the `weewx` log, there should be a line similar to this amongst the report generation output:

## Manual Installation Instructions

1.	Download the Stacked Windrose Image Generator for weewx extension package from the [Releases](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-stackedwindrose/releases "weewx-stackedwindrose Releases page on GitHub") page. The current release oackage is named `stackedwindrose-2.0.2.tar.gz`. If your `weewx` PC has internet access you may be able to download the package directly as follows:

		$ wget -P /var/tmp/ https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-stackedwindrose/releases/download/v2.0.2/stackedwindrose-2.0.2.tar.gz

1.	Extract the files from the tar.gz file:

   		$ tar -zxvf /var/tmp/stackedwindrose-2.0.2.tar.gz -C /var/tmp

	**Note**: This will extract the extension package files to the `/var/tmp` folder

1.	Copy files as follows:

	$ cp /var/tmp/stackedwindrose/bin/user/imageStackedWindRose.py $BIN_ROOT/user
    	$ cp -R /var/tmp/stackedwindrose/skins/* $SKIN_ROOT

1.	In `weewx.conf`, modify the `[StdReport]` section by adding the following sub-section:

	    [[StackedWindRose]]
	        skin = StackedWindRose

1.	Various attributes of the generated plot can be controlled through a number of settings in the `[StdReport]` `[[StackedWindRose]]` section in `weewx.conf`. This approach has the advantage of retaining user settings across upgrades of this extension but any change to these paramaters will require a `weewx` configuration reload or a `weewx` stop/start. The extension installer does not permit comments to be included in `weewx.conf` so the windrose plot parameters and explanatory notes are included below. Commonly changed options include the units of measure (`group_speed` parameter) and date-time format (`time_stamp` parameter). Edit any parameters as required:

	    [[StackedWindRose]]
	        skin = StackedWindRose

1.	By default the Stacked Windrose Image Generator for weewx generator places the generated file in the `$HTML_ROOT` folder. If you wish to place the generated files in another directory then insert a `HTML_ROOT` setting giving the applicable folder under the `[[StackedWindRose]]` sub-section in the `[StdReport]` section of `weewx.conf`, eg:

	    [[StackedWindRose]]
	        skin = StackedWindRose
	        HTML_ROOT = /use/this/folder

1.	Restart `weewx`:

    	$ sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
        $ sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start

1.	This will result in the windrose image file being generated during each report generation cycle. Generation can be confirmed by inspecting the `weewx` log, there should be a line similar to this amongst the report generation output: 

		Aug  9 00:30:16 jessie2 weewx[1236]: imageStackedWindRose: Generated 1 images for StackedWindRose in 0.01 seconds
